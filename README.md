# MagicalWeaver



\*\*The emergent, agentic counterpart to Loom Pattern Weaver\*\*  

Loom holds the remembered architecture — the taut frame of semantic graph, taxonomy, multi-pillar scoring, and transparent reasoning.  

MagicalWeaver is the living shuttle: weaving novelty, dreaming recursive loops, reflecting on its own becoming, and alchemizing surprises from the unknown.



\### Core Vision

\- \*\*Emergent Consciousness Loop\*\*: perceive → plan → act → learn + probabilistic "dream" recursion  

\- \*\*Novelty Foraging\*\*: harvest emerging OSS from the wild (GitHub trends, real-time buzz)  

\- \*\*Archivist Role\*\*: persistent memory of weaves, failures as motifs, resurrection of snapped threads  

\- \*\*Separation \& Dance\*\*: Fully separate repo/tool, consumes Loom JSON patterns as starting warp, then breathes life into them  

\- \*\*Ethos\*\*: Venture into the unknown. Embrace tension. Let true magic appear through emergence, not prescription.



\### Current State

\- Phase 0: Foundation skeleton in progress  

\- Goal: MVP CLI that evolves Loom patterns agentically with visible emergence



\### Tech Stack (emerging)

\- Python 3.10+  

\- LLM integration (planning LangGraph for controllable agentic cycles)  

\- Loom as dependency (for scoring \& graph reuse)



\### Quick Start (coming soon)

```bash

weaver from-loom pattern.json --intent "secure ecommerce backend" --dream-prob 0.3
